# ModbusTCP on ESP8266/ESP32

This project demonstrates how to implement a Modbus TCP server on ESP8266/ESP32. The implementation includes handling read and write requests for coils, discrete inputs, holding registers, and input registers. Additionally, it includes an example of controlling an LED using Modbus commands.
